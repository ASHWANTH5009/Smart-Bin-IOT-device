**Overview**

The Smart Dustbin project leverages IoT technology and Python to create an intelligent waste management system. This project aims to enhance traditional waste bins by providing real-time data on the fill level of the bin, promoting efficient waste collection, and contributing to a cleaner environment.

**Key Components:**

1. Arduino UNO : Acts as the brain of the system, facilitating communication with sensors and connecting to the Wi-Fi network.
   
2. Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the distance between the sensor and the nearest object (waste in the bin) to determine the fill level.

**Features:**

1. Distance Measurement: The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to the surface of the waste in the dustbin.

2. Web Server: The Arduino hosts a simple web server accessible over the Wi-Fi network.

3. Users can connect to the server and view the real-time status of the dustbin.

4. Status Monitoring: The web interface displays the current distance, which corresponds to the fill level of the dustbin

**How It Works:**

1. The ultrasonic sensor sends out ultrasonic waves and measures the time taken for the waves to bounce back.
   
2. The ESP32 processes this time data to calculate the distance to the nearest object, i.e., the waste in the dustbin.
   
3. The ESP32 updates the web server with the current distance information, allowing users to remotely monitor the dustbin’s fill level.

**Benefits:**

1. Efficient Waste Management: Optimize waste collection schedules based on real-time fill level data, reducing unnecessary collections and minimizing operational costs.

2. Remote Monitoring: Wi-Fi connectivity enables users to monitor the dustbin’s status remotely, promoting convenience and timely decision-making.

3.Environmental Impact: Efficient waste management reduces fuel consumption and minimizes the carbon footprint associated with unnecessary collection trips

**Usage:**

1.Connect to the web server hosted by the ESP32 to monitor the real-time status of the dustbin.

2.Use the web interface to check the fill level and decide when the bin needs to be emptied.
